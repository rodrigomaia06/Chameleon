Chameleon Cipher
====
A python program to encrypt and decrypt with the chameleon cipher.

## Prerequisites:
* Having python3 installed on your machine.

## Usage:
1step - Clone the repository or download it.

2step - You need to have your original deck and display it on the file "deck.txt". The first line of the file is the card on the top of the deck, and the last line of the file is the last card on the deck. The folder has an example of the "deck.txt" and you need to follow the structure for each line "(value of the card)_(suits)".

3step - Run the program with the correct arguments "-e" to encrypt(-e "msg") and "-d" to decrypt(-d "msg"). For more information use "-h" flag.

## Current limitations:
* This cipher ONLY works with letters, so spaces and punctuation signs will NOT be encrypted.
* Currently, you can't encrypt or decrypt text with double quotes.

### Version
* Version 1.2
